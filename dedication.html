    <p>This book is dedicated,</p>
    <p>in respect and admiration,</p>
    <p>to</p>
    <p><big>The Principle of Least Action</big></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&#x201C;The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to
        present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and
        on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually
        originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable
        that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest
        attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously
        to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann,
        according to whom matters of elegance ought be left to the tailor and
        to the cobbler.&#x201D;</p>
